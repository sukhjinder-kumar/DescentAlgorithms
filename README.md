# Descent Algorithms

---

## Setup 

This is a webapp that shows Gradient descent and its variants via interactive examples.

To use this first clone the repo, then follow these steps -

1. Create a virtual environment (Recommended). And please note python3.9.7 seems to have some compatability issues with streamlit library. You can use python3.10 for instance. Example if you have venv installed, use `python3.10 -m venv <environment name>`

2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Ensure you are in root directory of above code)

3. Run the app: `streamlit run index.py` 

## Documentation

- Each new algorithm has a seprate file in algorithm subfolder.
